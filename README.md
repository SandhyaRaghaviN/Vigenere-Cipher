# Vigenere-Cipher
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Vigenère Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text. It uses a simple form  of polyalphabetic substitution. A polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based on  substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets. The encryption of the  original text is done using the Vigenère square or Vigenère table. SAMPLE INPUT &amp; OUTPUT: Input: Plaintext: MICHIGAN TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY Keyword: HOUGHTON Output: Ciphertext: TWWNPZOA ASWNUHZBNWWGS NBVCSLYPMM For generating key, the given keyword is repeated in a circular manner until it  matches the length of the plain text. The keyword HOUGHTON generates the key HOUGHTON  HOUGHTONHOUGH TONHOUGNTO.  The plain text is then encrypted. HERE IS THE CODE FOR Vigenère Cipher:
